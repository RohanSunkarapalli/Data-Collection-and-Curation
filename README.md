# Data-Collection-and-Curation

In the two parts assignment, first, we gathered details of 7 books published and listed for sale on Amazon by Steven S. Skiena. Analyzed the best seller rank and user ratings. We also recommended a book to a friend as a gift based on the analysis. Second, we aim to create a ranking system and rank players in sports. We selected T20-international batsmen from the game of Cricket. The data was extracted from Cricinfo.com, the most widely followed news and blogging outlet.
